[ ] convert all imaging in encoder/decoder to PIL instead of graphics
[ ] implement bit masking in lsb exposure algorithm
	- mask all but the selected bit plane
	- create new image with black or white pixel
	- create composite image with white where pixels agree and red where they don't
	- show all 3, cover, composite, and carrier in tryptych (side by side)
